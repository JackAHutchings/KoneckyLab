# Laboratory Handbook

### MISSION STATEMENT

research goals; philosophy of how the lab works; chronological and academic history of the lab; ideas about future projects; why we do what we do

### ROLES & EXPECTATIONS

who's who and what they do all day, including the PI; expectations of everybody from everyone else's perspective

### OPEN SCIENCE

why and how the lab deals with sharing data, code, materials; how the lab does version control; how to do this stuff with lab collaborators

### COMMUNICATION

how people in the lab talk to each other; things like "always use Slack", "phone calls are only for emergencies"; how long to wait before nudging the PI on something you need; how meetings with PI work and what to prepare for them; check-ins/stand-ups/huddles

### LOGISTICS

* Although we have no strict policy on when and for how long you should be working, our general philosophy is to be present during normal business hours except under special circumstances.
* For students/post-docs, working from home or elsewhere _can_ be okay, but should be discussed with Bronwen prior to doing so for any sustained duration.
* We have three primary lab spaces, all in Rudolph Hall: \(1\) 252/254 is on the east end of the north wing of the second floor, \(2\) L91 is on the west end of the south wing of the basement, and \(3\) the Cold Room located on the west end of the north wing of the first floor \(adjacent to the loading dock\).

### ONBOARDING

master list of everything that new lab members need to deal with when starting out, including credentials, software, hardware, keys, university ID, etc

* A WashU ID card to needed for off-hours access to the building and is one of the first things to acquire. Office staff \(room 110\) will be of assistance on this matter. General questions can be answered at the [WashU Card Services website](https://card.wustl.edu/).
* Physical room keys are needed to access lab spaces and your office. Bob Osburn \(room 134\) handles this. Bob is also a font of knowledge on all things related to this building and its activities.
* WashU e-mail is administered through Office365, which will also grant you a full license to the Microsoft Office suite of software. This is initiated by our administrative staff \(room 110\).
* We use [WashU's Box cloud data storage](https://wustl.app.box.com/) for all types of files related to the lab. See Jack for access. We have a user storage folder, and all members of the lab are encouraged to make use of this. If you do not, you should **very seriously** consider another cloud data storage software \(Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft Onedrive\) for your research data. Hard-drive failures and lost/stolen laptops are a thing that happens, and losing your research data would be a huge bummer. If the cloud is frightening, we can talk about physical backup solutions.
* In addition to [campus-wide software licenses](http://sl.wustl.edu/catalog/), our department holds a number of licenses for things such as Adobe Creative Suite and Acrobat Reader. See Hugh Chou \(room 289\) for details.

### RECURRING EVENTS

logistics and structure of lab meetings, departmental seminars, etc; daily and weekly task lists \(differing by lab roles\)

### DAY-TO-DAY

dress code & hygiene; can you bring your dog to the lab; person X has a peanut allergy so please pack your lunch carefully; health stuff; work-life balance

### BEHAVIOR

official code of conduct; policies on scientific integrity, sexual harassment, discrimination; lab culture stuff "the kind of lab we are trying to be" and "things about our lab students like/dislike"; what to do if you have a problem; university-level information

### ETHICS AND SAFETY

Our lab routinely uses hazardous materials and operates instruments that can pose serious health risks when misused. Prior to performing **any** work in the lab, all members of the WashU community \(students, postdocs, staff, faculty\) must take the Environmental Health & Safety Laboratory Safety Training available using the [Learn@Work website](https://wustl.sabacloud.com). Completion of this training includes passing a series of tests and a record of successful completion is **mandatory**. In addition \(and for any visiting collaborators\), the Lab Specific Safety Training document on this site must be read and documented within our lab safety book.

### ENGAGEMENT

how lab website and social media work; expectations surrounding public outreach, including from official lab accounts; social media policy for personal accounts; protocol for recruiting participants in the community; being a good departmental citizen

### HOW TO RUN EXPERIMENTS

detailed instructions for doing research; some labs do this for all experiments separately while others have a general set of instructions like "how you should interact with participants"; how to compensate participants

### DATA ANALYSIS

how the lab does analyses; expectations concerning how code is written, version controlled, and archived; how to handle data protection and security. this one overlaps with OPEN SCIENCE quite a bit

### PUBLICATIONS

how the lab deals with authorship, including the differences between listing in acknowledgments & co-authors; checklist of everything to do before a paper is published; policies on preprints, postprints, and open access; preferences about journals

###  CONFERENCES

how to give a talk; which conferences do lab members usually attend and why; technology considerations surrounding visualizations; data considerations for work-in-progress; discussion of [\#betterposter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/betterposter?src=hashtag_click) or [\#worseposter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/worseposter?src=hashtag_click), etc

### MONEY

what grants pay for the lab and why; what the lab will and won't pay for, usually \(differs by roles\); what grants people could/should apply for; what to expect for conference expenses, computers, etc

### OFFBOARDING

what to do when you leave the lab; making sure all data & materials are archived properly; transferring credentials; how to stay in touch \(what happens to your Slack account\)

### MENTORSHIP AND DEVELOPMENT

how to choose a project; how to get feedback from others on new ideas; how to initiate collaborations inside/outside the lab; doing a thesis/dissertation; professional development at university level; rec letters

### WHAT TO DO IF YOU NEED HELP

how to get support from inside or outside the lab; schedule of routine training for new members; things that bear repeating like "always ask questions!"; how to make mistakes productively

### READING LIST

a list of papers, blog posts, and news articles that all students and lab members should read
