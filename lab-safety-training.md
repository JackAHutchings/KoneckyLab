# Lab Safety Training

#### I.       Food and Drink Transport Policy

* Leave all food and drink outside of the laboratory.
* Absolutely no consumption of food or drink is acceptable within the laboratory! This includes chewing gum.
* This is inclusive of **all** of our lab spaces - rooms 252, 254, L91, and the cold room.

#### II.    Use of Volatile Organic Chemicals, Corrosives, Flammable Materials, Reactive Materials/Oxidizers and Toxins

* Practically all organic solvents used by our lab are flammable!
* Acids and bases in solution are typically corrosive. Many bases when dry \(e.g., dry sodium hydroxide\) are not considered corrosive, but should still be handled with use of personal protective equipment \(PPE\).
* Remove and replace your gloves any time you suspect a chemical might have come into contact with them.
* Acetyl chloride \(stored within a glass desiccator\) reacts with water to produce hydrochloric acid and acetic acid, including water in your membranes! This should only be handled during preparation of anhydrous methanolic hydrochloric acid for fatty acid esterification and only within a fume hood, with PPE, and after training and approval by Bronwen or Jack.

#### III.  Use of peroxide-forming materials \(ether, picric acid, etc.\)

* Diethyl ether forms peroxides over time and must be disposed of prior to its expiration date. Inspect the bottle’s expiration date each time it is used. Secondary containers \(i.e., solutions\) of diethyl ether must be disposed of within 2 weeks of creation.

#### IV.   Use of reproductive toxins / select agents & toxins / pathogenic agents / bloodborne pathogens / human cell lines

* This lab does not utilize any of these substances.

#### V.     Use of a chemical fume hood

* All wet chemical work should, by default, be performed within a fume hood. Rare exceptions should be cleared with Jack or Bronwen.

#### VI.   Use of gas cylinders

* When installing a new cylinder, remove the ‘Full’ part of its tag. After installing the regulator, open the cylinder’s valve and note the pressure on its tag.
* Even if the cylinder appears empty, close the main valve prior to removing the regulator. When empty, remove the “Partially Full” tag and, if necessary, indicate the pressure of the remaining contents.
* H2 is kept in a special cabinet in 252 because H2 gas is extremely explosive when mixed with air. The cabinet is equipped with a hydrogen detector, alarm, and pneumatic shut-off valve, and the cabinet itself is plumbed into the building’s ventilation system. If a H2 leak is detected, a loud alarm will sound \(audible from anywhere in the 2nd floor hallway\) and the valve will automatically close, containing the leak. The alarm will continue to sound until it has been manually reset. If you hear an alarm, stop working and leave the laboratory, and notify Bronwen and Jack immediately.
* The H2 tank cabinet in 252 should not be handled. If the tank needs to be changed, notify Bronwen or Jack.

#### VII.   Use of specialized lab equipment

* Muffle furnace: This is typically used for combusting glassware at 500°C for removal of organics. However, it has the capability to melt glass if used incorrectly \(can achieve 1200°C\). This will destroy the glass as well as the furnace itself! Always check the program prior to running. If you alter the default program, leave a large, visible note on the door of the furnace.
* ASE350: This extracts sediment at high temperature and pressure using organic solvents. The vials are largely left open and thus the unit generates some organic vapors. Ensure the fume snorkel is in position and open above the instrument prior to use.
* Ultrasonication bath: Do not place hands in the bath during operation. Organic solvents should be sonicated only within completely sealed PFA jars.

#### VIII.   Use of carcinogens

* Many organic solvents are suspected carcinogens. However, the only chemical we use that is a known human carcinogen is dichloromethane \(also called methylene chloride or DCM\).

#### IX.   Use and testing of safety equipment

* Our lab houses the following emergency safety equipment: eye wash stations \(252 and 254\), laboratory shower \(254\), fire extinguisher \(254\), and a chemical spill kit \(254\). This equipment is checked regularly by the lab manager.
* If a large spill \(i.e., &gt; 500 mL\) occurs, the spill kit in 254 contains a sorbent \(clay\), sorbent pads, and a 2 gallon bucket for containment. This is located under the sink adjacent to the analytical balance. For large, emergency spills, evacuate as necessary and call campus police at 314-935-5555 \(5-5555 from a campus phone\).

#### X.     Personal protective equipment

* Standard PPE within our lab is a lab coat, nitrile gloves, and safety glasses. Usage of these items should be considered the default state when operating within the laboratory. Additional PPE should be used based on the application.
* Nitrile gloves should not be worn outside the laboratory!

#### XI.   Laboratory attire

* Close-toed shoes are required at all times.
* When possible, wear loose-fitting, long pants.
* Tie back long hair, both for safety and to avoid potential contamination.

#### XII.   Thermal hazards

* Ovens \(gravity & muffle furnace\), the dry heating block, dishwasher, Flexivap heating block, and analytical instruments can all be operated at dangerous temperatures and care should be taken during handling. Do not use any of the above without knowledge of how to take a temperature reading.

#### XIII.   Disposal of hazardous materials

* Hazardous waste collection vessels should all have a completed “Unwanted Material” label.
* Waste in a single bottle should be removed within 6 months of the start date and within 10 days of being filled.
* Submit a waste pickup request as soon as possible \(preferable immediately\) upon filling a container. Alternatively, notify the lab manager \(Jack\) immediately. Peroxide-forming solvents \(e.g., diethyl ether\) have an expiration date and become explosive hazards if stored beyond this date.
