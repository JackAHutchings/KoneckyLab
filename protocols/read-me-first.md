# Read me first!

A protocol is the 'standard operating procedure' for a given task. These are typically standard approaches within our discipline that have been adapted to our workflow and equipment. While these are 'tried and true', for most tasks there are multiple ways to do something. However, the first place you look and the first thing you should try will be one of our protocols.

A few caveats:

* While these are known to work, exceptions \(read: **failures**\) can and do occur, sometimes in multiples. Documenting your work via lab notebook and recording what failed and \(if possible\) why are both critical tasks to successful lab work. If something doesn't turn out as expected, seek the advice of Bronwen or Jack and we will be happy to assist with troubleshooting.
* These are not necessarily the best way to do any of the tasks. You might read a publication, talk to someone at a conference \(or on Twitter!\), or just get an idea. **Stop!** It is imperative that you get some clearance from either Bronwen or Jack before changing a step. If you think a change will improve the results, shorten the workload, or save on resources, that is great. But, any changes must be done in a controlled and documented manner. A fair warning: method development is its own research path. Consider if you really want/need to go down that path!
